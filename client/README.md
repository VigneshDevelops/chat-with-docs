# Chat with docs React Project

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project requires Node.js version ^18.18.0.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ChatDocsWithLLM
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite's development server and open your default browser to preview the application. Any changes made to the source files will automatically trigger hot module replacement (HMR).

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will transpile TypeScript files using TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and then build the project using Vite. The optimized production build will be available in the `dist` directory.
